        Question: Can you make an equality check (==) with the following two values. 6.1 and 7. Meaning, are we allowed (will it compile) if we write this code, 6.1 == 7.
         a - We can't compare an Int against a Double. When making an equality check, both values need to be of the same type.
         b - We can compare both numbers without a problem.
         c - We can compare both numbers if we convert one type to be the same as the other.
